# Hi professor Gio!
# The project is kind of the modification of the gen_audio.py from week6...
# It's through console using in the vscode python 3.12.4
When you clip the play,
enter one's name...(Ada is recommended...)
enter one's age...
It will generate a segment of music, the music is same as the age with a name meaning similar to the name...
Bonus! Before the music begins, the audio will play a segment of audio-------
"DJ 'one's name'! We the best music!!!"
I hate DJ Khaled :(
